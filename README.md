# Open Science Labs Proof of Concept repositories (OSL-PoCs)

**OSL PoCs** is a GitHub organization used by Open Science Labs community in order to provide the 
results from an exploration of any open technology by any member of OSL community.

## Criteria

In order to keep consistency among all PoCs repository, we developed some criteria and rules.

Note: All the PoCs should be related to an open Tehcnology. 


**Repository settings**:

- Keep deactivated GitHub Wiki, Projects and Discussions, unless you want to use and maintain that.
- Keep the option "Sponsorships" active and configure it to have: `github: [openscienlabs, osl-incubator]`.
- About the Pull Request approach, just keep active the option "Allow squash merging".
- Not required, but maybe the option "Automatically delete head branches" would be helpful.

**README file**:

- Feel free to add a sponsorship button/link on the README file for any contributor to that PoC.
- Add an explanation about the project and examples about how to install and run it
